Ring a bell, anyone? Now, a little boy named Derek heard a knock at the door one evening, and opened it to find a present on the doorstep for him. Even though it said \"don\\'t open till Christmas\", he begins to open it anyway but is stopped by his dad, who scolds him and sends him to bed, and opens the gift himself. Inside is a little red ball that sprouts Santa arms and a head, and proceeds to kill dad. Oops, maybe he should have left well-enough alone. Of course Derek is then traumatized by the incident since he watched it from the stairs, but he doesn\\'t grow up to be some killer Santa, he just stops talking.<br /><br />There\\'s a mysterious stranger lurking around, who seems very interested in the toys that Joe Petto makes. We even see him buying a bunch when Derek\\'s mom takes him to the store to find a gift for him to bring him out of his trauma. And what exactly is this guy doing? Well, we\\'re not sure but he does seem to be taking these toys apart to see what makes them tick. He does keep his landlord from evicting him by promising him to pay him in cash the next day and presents him with a \"Larry the Larvae\" toy for his kid, but of course \"Larry\" is not a good toy and gets out of the box in the car and of course, well, things aren\\'t pretty.<br /><br />Anyway, eventually what\\'s going on with Joe Petto and Pino is of course revealed, and as with the old story, Pino is not a \"real boy\". Pino is probably even more agitated and naughty because he suffers from \"Kenitalia\" (a smooth plastic crotch) so that could account for his evil ways. And the identity of the lurking stranger is revealed too, and there\\'s even kind of a happy ending of sorts. Whee.<br /><br />A step up from part 4, but not much of one. Again, Brian Yuzna is involved, and Screaming Mad George, so some decent special effects, but not enough to make this great. A few leftovers from part 4 are hanging around too, like Clint Howard and Neith Hunter, but that doesn\\'t really make any difference. Anyway, I now have seeing the whole series out of my system.

The inflation adjusted rate is calculated on a six month basis.  They currently yield 3.53% apy and have a 30 year duration.  The interest you accrue is tax deferred meaning you can wait until you sell the bond to pay taxes on the interest.  You can elect to receive your federal tax refund in I-series bonds, and this does not count against the $10,000 purchase limit.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEE-series bonds pay a fixed rate.  After 20 years, the bond value is adjusted to double what you paid when you purchased it.  The fixed rate is only 0.10%, but if you hold for 20 years, the value doubles which works out to 3.53% APY.  The bonds continue to earn interest after 20 years at a rate set by the US Treasury.  The interest is tax deferred just like I-series bonds.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBoth types of bonds are pretty simple to buy.  You make an account on the treasurydirect website, link a bank account, and schedule the purchase.  You redeem the bonds by selling them on the treasurydirect website and the money is deposited into your linked bank account.  The I-series bonds from federal tax returns are paper bonds which you redeem at any bank.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNote that these are bonds, not treasuries, so their value does not fluctuate based on market conditions.  If you bought us treasuries, and the interest rate goes up, the amount you can sell your treasury for goes down unless you hold it for the full duration.  If you purchase a bond, and the interest rate goes up, you can redeem it for the amount you paid plus any interest that accrued.  There is an early withdrawl penalty for I-series and EE-series bonds but it is only a few months interest that you lose.  You can pull your full investment out at any time with no penalty.  Redeeming your EE-series bond before 20 years can be brutal as you would only collect the 0.10% apy instead of the cumulative 3.53% that is realized at 20 years upon doubling.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy personal strategy for investing on a \\\\~75k gross income:\\n\\nMax 401k pre tax ($19.5k)\\n\\nNON40OXEA (Vanguard 2055 target date blended retirement fund, 0.05% expense ratio)\\n\\nMax Roth IRA after tax ($6k)\\n\\n60% FZROX (Fidelity total market US equities fund, 0% expense ratio)\\n\\n30% FZILX (Fidelity total market international equities fund, 0% expense ratio)\\n\\n10% FXNAX (Fidelity US bonds fund, 0.025% expense ratio)\\n\\nMax I-Bonds after tax ($10k)\\n\\nTake federal tax return in I-Bonds (\\\\~$2k)\\n\\nTry really hard to buy $833.33 of EE-series bonds each month with leftover money ($10k)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI plan to retire at 40, live off the I-Bonds until 50, live off the EE-bonds until 60, then live like a filthy rich multimillionaire old geezer off the 401k and IRA.

The inflation adjusted rate is calculated on a six month basis.  They currently yield 3.53% apy and have a 30 year duration.  The interest you accrue is tax deferred meaning you can wait until you sell the bond to pay taxes on the interest.  You can elect to receive your federal tax refund in I-series bonds, and this does not count against the $10,000 purchase limit.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEE-series bonds pay a fixed rate.  After 20 years, the bond value is adjusted to double what you paid when you purchased it.  The fixed rate is only 0.10%, but if you hold for 20 years, the value doubles which works out to 3.53% APY.  The bonds continue to earn interest after 20 years at a rate set by the US Treasury.  The interest is tax deferred just like I-series bonds.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBoth types of bonds are pretty simple to buy.  You make an account on the treasurydirect website, link a bank account, and schedule the purchase.  You redeem the bonds by selling them on the treasurydirect website and the money is deposited into your linked bank account.  The I-series bonds from federal tax returns are paper bonds which you redeem at any bank.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNote that these are bonds, not treasuries, so their value does not fluctuate based on market conditions.  If you bought us treasuries, and the interest rate goes up, the amount you can sell your treasury for goes down unless you hold it for the full duration.  If you purchase a bond, and the interest rate goes up, you can redeem it for the amount you paid plus any interest that accrued.  There is an early withdrawl penalty for I-series and EE-series bonds but it is only a few months interest that you lose.  You can pull your full investment out at any time with no penalty.  Redeeming your EE-series bond before 20 years can be brutal as you would only collect the 0.10% apy instead of the cumulative 3.53% that is realized at 20 years upon doubling.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy personal strategy for investing on a \\\\~75k gross income:\\n\\nMax 401k pre tax ($19.5k)\\n\\nNON40OXEA (Vanguard 2055 target date blended retirement fund, 0.05% expense ratio)\\n\\nMax Roth IRA after tax ($6k)\\n\\n60% FZROX (Fidelity total market US equities fund, 0% expense ratio)\\n\\n30% FZILX (Fidelity total market international equities fund, 0% expense ratio)\\n\\n10% FXNAX (Fidelity US bonds fund, 0.025% expense ratio)\\n\\nMax I-Bonds after tax ($10k)\\n\\nTake federal tax return in I-Bonds (\\\\~$2k)\\n\\nTry really hard to buy $833.33 of EE-series bonds each month with leftover money ($10k)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI plan to retire at 40, live off the I-Bonds until 50, live off the EE-bonds until 60, then live like a filthy rich multimillionaire old geezer off the 401k and IRA.

inflation adjusted rate.  the inflation adjusted rate is calculated on a six month basis.  they currently yield 3.53% apy and have a 30 year duration.  the interest you accrue is tax deferred meaning you can wait until you sell the bond to pay taxes on the interest.  you can elect to receive your federal tax refund in i-series bonds, and this does not count against the $10,000 purchase limit.&#x200b;ee-series bonds pay a fixed rate.  after 20 years, the bond value is adjusted to double what you paid when you purchased it.  the fixed rate is only 0.10%, but if you hold for 20 years, the value doubles which works out to 3.53% apy.  the bonds continue to earn interest after 20 years at a rate set by the us treasury.  the interest is tax deferred just like i-series bonds.&#x200b;both types of bonds are pretty simple to buy.  you make an account on the treasurydirect website, link a bank account, and schedule the purchase.  you redeem the bonds by selling them on the treasurydirect website and the money is deposited into your linked bank account.  the i-series bonds from federal tax returns are paper bonds which you redeem at any bank.&#x200b;note that these are bonds, not treasuries, so their value does not fluctuate based on market conditions.  if you bought us treasuries, and the interest rate goes up, the amount you can sell your treasury for goes down unless you hold it for the full duration.  if you purchase a bond, and the interest rate goes up, you can redeem it for the amount you paid plus any interest that accrued.  there is an early withdrawl penalty for i-series and ee-series bonds but it is only a few months interest that you lose.  you can pull your full investment out at any time with no penalty.  redeeming your ee-series

inflation adjusted rate.  the inflation adjusted rate is calculated on a six month basis.  they currently yield 3.53% apy and have a 30 year duration.  the interest you accrue is tax deferred meaning you can wait until you sell the bond to pay taxes on the interest.  you can elect to receive your federal tax refund in i-series bonds, and this does not count against the $10,000 purchase limit.&#x200b;ee-series bonds pay a fixed rate.  after 20 years, the bond value is adjusted to double what you paid when you purchased it.  the fixed rate is only 0.10%, but if you hold for 20 years, the value doubles which works out to 3.53% apy.  the bonds continue to earn interest after 20 years at a rate set by the us treasury.  the interest is tax deferred just like i-series bonds.&#x200b;both types of bonds are pretty simple to buy.  you make an account on the treasurydirect website, link a bank account, and schedule the purchase.  you redeem the bonds by selling them on the treasurydirect website and the money is deposited into your linked bank account.  the i-series bonds from federal tax returns are paper bonds which you redeem at any bank.&#x200b;note that these are bonds, not treasuries, so their value does not fluctuate based on market conditions.  if you bought us treasuries, and the interest rate goes up, the amount you can sell your treasury for goes down unless you hold it for the full duration.  if you purchase a bond, and the interest rate goes up, you can redeem it for the amount you paid plus any interest that accrued.  there is an early withdrawl penalty for i-series and ee-series bonds but it is only a few months interest that you lose.  you can pull your full investment out at any time with no penalty.  redeeming your ee-series bond before 20 years can be brutal as you would only collect the 0.10% apy instead of the cumulative 3.53% that is realized at 20 years upon doubling.&#x200b;my personal strategy for investing on a
