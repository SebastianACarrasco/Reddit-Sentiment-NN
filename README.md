# Reddit-Sentiment-NN
This project uses a binary text classification neural network developed with Keras to predict sub-reddit sentiment on the markets. At the very end it displays a pie chart depicting percentage of bear and bull sentiments

The project consists of two parts, the neural net and the reddit web-crawler
Mostly uses Keras library and PRAW (Reddits API)
subreddits are stored in a list and can be changed anytime

**DISCLAIMER**: The data fed to the NN is by no means very accurate as some comments speak nonsense given it's Reddit. Also, given the amount of subreddits and comments it goes through, the program should take about 15-20 minutes to finish running.
